These are our recommendations to build an ideal track-day bag. We'll only recommend something if we've directly tested it or a similar item from the same manufacturer.

### #1. A Reliable, Accurate Tire Pressure Gauge

This tire pressure gauge has proven accurate and reliable in our track bag over several years. We trust it for reliably taking and bleeding pressure throughout the track day after some abuse tossed in the track day bag with all the other stuff.

[Buy it on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3YzgsMD)

### #2. A Reliable, Accurate Torque Wrench

GEARWRENCH makes quality, accurate torque wrenches. The electronic function really makes a difference if you're reprogramming the torque often or if you don't have patience to convert between foot-pounds and newton-meters. We use it for double-checking the torque on lug nuts at the beginning of a track day after arrival, but it would be just as useful when changing street wheels and tires over to track wheels and tires.

Want to save a buck? Get the analog version. We use the electronic torque wrench at the garage, and keep an analog wrench in the track day bag.

### #3. Wheel Protector Socket Set

The outer sheath on these sockets will prevent you from marring the finish on your wheels when torquing lug nuts. Get another set for the home garage when using an impact--don't bugger up your expensive wheels!

### #4. Microfiber Towels

These microfiber towels are a fine place to go cheap. It's a game changer to keep a stack of these in your track day bag for cleaning your windshield between sessions, and handy in a pinch for any other clean up or spills. Machine washer after a session to re-use.

### #5. Windex

Use this for cleaning the bugs and oil off your windshield between sessions, keeping your visor clear, or anything else you may need to clean up.

CRAFTSMAN's tire inflator connects to your car's 12v accessory power. Use it to air up your tires at the end of the track day if you're hitting the highway to drive home.
